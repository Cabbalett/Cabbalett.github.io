I am a master's student in [Data Mining Lab](https://dm.kaist.ac.kr/) at KAIST, advised by Prof. [Jae-Gil Lee](https://www.kaistdmlab.org/jaegil).

My research interests are concerned with data quality aspect of general deep learning, such as active learning, data selection, data curation, etc. I focus on investigating data properties that can improve the AI performance, which particular interest in curating datasets to guide models toward specific goals, such as implementing constraints to a model or achieving targeted outcomes. Additionally, I am interested in designing datasets that facilitate efficient and effective training of large-scale models, including both pre-training and fine-tuning stages.

I received my bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science(minor) at KAIST in 2023. Moreover, I have worked on *selecting informative data in continuous data shifts* during my master's program.

I am looking forward to pursue research that leverages the generalization capabilities of foundation models to further improve the performance of already highly effective models.
